# PekaoCoders Warsaw 2019 :trophy: :trophy: :trophy:
This is an app developed by team Coders02 for a hackathon [pekaocoders](https://www.pekaocoders.pl). It servers a purpose of
finding the best location for a given type of business. We described the developement process with a great detail across 2
[blogposts](https://kulikowski.tech/2019/we-won-pekao/)

# Usage
During and shortly after the hackathon our app has been accessable at http://pekao.kulikowski.tech/ - however we probably
turned it off by now. You can build the app locally using Django's and React's standard practices and then editing configs
to work properly on your machine.

# Code quality
It is bad and we know it. [@wkulikowski](https://github.com/wkulikowski) is responsible for the terrible backend and
[@dstawinski](https://github.com/dstawinski) for the beautiful front. Please don't judge :sweat_smile:

# Design
We wanted to achieve a simple and friendly design. It wasn't hard as we didn't produce that much content :wink:
Our web page looks like this on mobile phones: (**Warning!** It is partially in Polish :worried:

and this is the view of the output map we presented to our users:

# Further developement
We aim to make the code readible in the future. This is number one. Than we plan to extend our solution to cities other than
Warsaw and prepare the system for the grand finals in November 2019 :trophy:
